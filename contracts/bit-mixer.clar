;; Title: BitMixer - Decentralized Privacy Protocol for STX
;;
;; Summary: Secure, compliant mixing service for STX tokens enabling privacy-preserving transactions
;;
;; Description:
;; BitMixer is a regulatory-compliant privacy protocol built on Stacks that enables users to
;; protect their financial privacy while maintaining full transparency for compliance purposes.
;; The protocol implements a non-custodial pool-based mixing service with built-in rate limiting,
;; safety checks, and protocol fees to ensure long-term sustainability.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Self-custodial deposits and withdrawals
;; - Multi-participant mixing pools with configurable parameters
;; - Daily transaction limits for regulatory compliance
;; - Protocol fees to sustain development
;; - Emergency pause functionality for security incidents
;; - Transparent pool creation and distribution mechanisms
